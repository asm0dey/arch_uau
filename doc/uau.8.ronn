uAu(1) -- unattended Arch upgrade is a little helper to damage your system by installing Arch upgrades non-interactively
====

## SYNOPSIS

`uau` (will be executed by systemd)<br>
`uau-news` (will be executed by `uau`)

## DESCRIPTION

Unattended upgrades are completely against the Arch philosophy!

So **NEVER ever** set the _AUTOUPGRADE_ of uAu ;)


**The usual Arch upgrade flow**

BEFORE starting any upgrade

    1) Read the Arch news site
    2) If you use packages from the AUR it is recommended to check the latest comments there
    3) Take your time for doing the upgrade

DOING the upgrade

    4) Always sync the databases before doing anything else
    5) Partial Upgrades are totally unsupported! So never ever use "IgnorePkg" --ignore or --ignoregroup
    6) Sit down, answer questions, make the upgrade interactively

AFTER the upgrade

    7) Check systemd failure states
    8) Check journal for high prio errors
    

**The uAu flow (default)**

uAu will by default do for you:

    steps 1,2 and 4 and send this by Email so you stay informed in order to do the other steps


**The uAu flow (advanced)**

uAu CAN do for you (if you change the default setting):

    steps 1-8 and send you the results by Email
    (means a fully unattended upgrade with all the above)

## FILES
